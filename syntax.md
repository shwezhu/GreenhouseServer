# Syntax in python

## 1. None
Python uses the keyword None to define null objects and variables.

None is not 0. 

If the function doesn't return anything that means its None in Python.

## 2. Method
A `staticmethod` is a method that knows nothing about the class or instance it was called on. 

A `classmethod`, on the other hand, is a method that gets passed the class it was called on, or the class of the instance it was called on, as first argument.
